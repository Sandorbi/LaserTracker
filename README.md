# LaserTracker

This project presents the development of a laser tracking system that uses stereographic vision to detect, locate, and follow a laser point in real time. The system is built on a dual-camera setup, where two synchronized cameras capture the laser spot from different perspectives. By applying stereo triangulation techniques, the system calculates the precise 3D position and distance of the laser point relative to the tracking mechanism. This data allows the platform to point accurately toward the laser target.
The topic is highly relevant due to the growing demand for automated tracking technologies in robotics, surveillance, and humanâ€“machine interaction. Traditional single-camera systems are unable to determine depth accurately, which limits their use in spatially dynamic environments. In contrast, stereography provides depth estimation without requiring expensive LiDAR sensors, making this approach cost-effective and accessible for educational, research, and practical applications.
The main goal of the project is to design a functional prototype capable of continuously tracking a laser pointer with minimal delay and high positional accuracy. The system combines hardware components such as cameras, ESP32 microcontroller, and NEMA23 stepper motor with software algorithms for image processing, camera calibration, and coordinate transformation. The cameras detect the laser using HSV color filtering, while triangulation formulas convert the pixel coordinates into real-world distances.
The results demonstrate successful laser point detection and accurate distance measurement across different ranges. The prototype efficiently follows the laser target in real time and responds smoothly to changes in position. This confirms that stereographic vision can be a reliable alternative to more complex and expensive depth-sensing technologies. Future improvements could include faster image processing, AI-based prediction, wireless control, and integration with autonomous systems, making the platform more scalable, adaptable, and usable across various fields such as education, robotics competitions, and industrial automation.
